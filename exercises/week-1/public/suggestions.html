      <!-- In this section, create a form that allows people to send questions
        to the customer service department of your online business. Your form
        should have text inputs for a person's name and email address as well as
        a dropdown list (select tag) for the type of question [Bug Report,
        Feature Request, Sales, Other] and a text area for the question itself.

        Each element of the form should be on its own line, and each element
        should have a label identifying what it is, e.g. Name, Email, Query, and
        Question. Add an action to the form that points to this page, and add a
        Submit button that triggers the action. Naturally, the form won't do
        anything except  reload the page, but it's a start! -->
